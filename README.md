Project Overview:

For this project, I have used a synthetic dataset for a fictional e-commerce platform, The Virtual Vault. The dataset simulates real-world scenarios, capturing the essential aspects of online retail, such as customer demographics, purchase behavior, product categories, and returns.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how data analytics can be used to extract valuable insights that drive business growth and customer satisfaction. Through this analysis, the aim is to explore sales trends, customer segmentation, and operational efficiencies to support strategic decision-making at The Virtual Vault.

Dataset overview:
The dataset consists of multiple tables representing different business aspects:

1) orders table – Order details (Order ID, Date, Amount, Customer ID, Product ID)
2) customers table – Customer demographics (Customer ID, Name, Country, City)
3) product table- Product details (Product ID, Name, Category, sub-category, Price)
4) returns table – Return records (Order ID, Customer ID, Return Reason)

Dashboards created:
